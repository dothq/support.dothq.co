# How to download Dot Browser on Mac OS

Download Dot Browser by downloading [the DMG file](https://github.com/dothq/browser-desktop/releases).
After opening Dot you may get a warning saying, "Dot Browser cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified." 
This is normal, just click cancel on the warning, go into System Preferences > Security and Privacy, 
and then click open anyway to allow dot browser to run and then another warning prompt should come up and click open on that one. 
Now Dot Browser should open like normal
